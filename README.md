## _Fake Minecraft_ ![](https://geps.dev/progress/90)

A 3D voxel-based game inspired by Minecraft, built using a custom version of the SGG (Simple Game Graphics) library. This project aims to recreate the core features of Minecraft, including terrain generation, block placement, and more, while allowing for experimentation with custom mechanics and optimizations.

## Features
- _Voxel Terrain: Infinite terrain generation using procedural algorithms._
- _Block Placement & Destruction: Players can interact with the environment by placing and removing blocks._

## Tech

The tools bellow were used to create my game:

- [C++] -  Visual Studio Tools? ðŸ¤”
- [Math] - Read a book or something? ðŸ¤”
- [Tears] ðŸ˜­
## Installation (Windows x64 Exclusively)

- The game requires [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/) in order to compile.
- You need the custom image of [SGG](https://github.com/diamondpixel/sgg) library.
- Also you need the MVSC compiler, trying to compile with MinGW will result in errors.

```bat
Dunno i just use CLion and you should too. Fuck Visual Studio...
